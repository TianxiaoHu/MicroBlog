# MicroBlog
Following [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) to develop a MicroBlog using flask step by step.

This MicroBlog is ugly because it contains nothing about web UI(basic HTML is used). However, the *flask* logic is quite clear to read.

Changes: Fix some **outdated** code in the toturial and a user system is created.
